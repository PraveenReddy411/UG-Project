# UG-Project
The  main aim of the project is t transfer the information trough wireless sensor networks from the bottom of the water to the sink located on the top of the  water...


Establishing communication for transfer of sensed data from sensors to sink is a challenging issue.
The sink placed on the surface procures the data from sensors within the ocean column and transfers it to the monitoring centre.
The underwater environment inherent mobility makes intermittent connectivity in sensors which are out of range Communication leading to void. 
So contribution in this work deals with TPVA (Transmission Probability for Void Avoidance) has been proposed for Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSN). 
The transmission probability for finding the void node governed by retransmission probability using minimal overhead provides suitable forwarding node.
This results being simulated using ns2 simulator incorporated with aquasim patch states that increased delivery ratio and minimal overhead are obtained compared to Depth Based Routing (DBR).
Keywords: Communication void, Under-water wireless sensor nodes, Random Waypoint mobility model.
